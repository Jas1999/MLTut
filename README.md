A couple of the Machine learning tutorials find so I figured I should push it,
ones I remeber doing, but couldn't find would be the amazon reviews one, hate speech detection

ML Titanic: https://github.com/UWCoffeeNCode/Past-Projects/tree/master/F19/Projects/MachineLearning-Titanic

done on kaggle ( and part of reason these were easy to find):

  Boat Image (CNN w TensorFlow),
  COVID Mortality related to Diet (TensorFlow), 
  fruit classification(TensorFlow) ,
  housing(Pytorch),
  usedcarprices(LinearRegression)
for these I followed videos by : Gabriel Atkin on youtube (I recommend his Data every day playlist)
